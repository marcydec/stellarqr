<hr />

<p><img src="/stellarqr/assets/img/cosmogonia.png" alt="Cosmogony" /></p>

<p>According to Greek mythology, however, in the
beginning there was Chaos, that is, a universal and
disordered mixture of matter; however, this disorder
was a divinity capable of generating: it is
Cosmogony. Most of the children of Chaos were
capricious and malevolent deities. According to the
cosmogony of Greek mythology, Destiny or Fate,
now benign, now hostile, was born from Chaos.
Then many other deities were born: Erebus, a kind
of bottomless abyss; the Night, also dark, but the
bearer of rest and advice; le Moire, ministers of
Destiny; discord and old age. Later more forgiving
divinities were born: Concordia, Love, Day, Uranus
(i.e. Heaven) and Gea (i.e. Earth).
Thus, by the will of Love, Night and Day, Concord
and Discord, Heaven and Earth, formed
personalities distinct from the others, ceasing to be
the mixture of Chaos. Thus, from Chaos (disorder)
the Cosmos (order) began to take shape:
cosmogony is now in its advanced state.
Uranus is the first god who reigned over the
Universe as soon as it emerged from the chaos of
Chaos. He married Gea and they had several children.
Among them, the main ones are the Titans (including 
Oceanus and Cronos) and the Cyclopes.</p>
